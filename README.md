# Overview

I wrote this password manager to help me learn Rust. I had a lot of fun doing it, and got to learn about a lot more parts of Rust than I thought I would.

I wrote a simple command line password manager. When you run the program, a password is required to write new passwords, or access existing passwords. The password/username data is then stored in a JSON file.

I wrote this software to learn, but also because I am a victim of often using the same password over and over, and am trying to get better at using different passwords. It is easier to use different passwords when a program remembers them for you.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The software was developed on MacOS using VSCode.

The program was written in Rust. The libraries I used were the Rust Standard Library, and serde_json.

# Future Work

-   Make it so password is kept secret while typing it
-   Clean up the code and use functions to keep things tidy
-   Make it so passwords can be edited and deleted
-   Add some sort of a menu so they can select what they want to do rather than having to select yes or no
